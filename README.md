# OpenDHT-packaging

Debian, Homebrew and Alpine Linux packaging for OpenDHT

## Debian

We maintain the version here to keep up to date with the latest OpenDHT. We also push this to a [Ubuntu PPA](https://launchpad.net/~gavinhenry/+archive/ubuntu/opendht)

This original version was copied from the [Debian Salsa repo](https://salsa.debian.org/debian/opendht) which I [forked](https://salsa.debian.org/ghenry/opendht).

## Homebrew

[OpenDHT is in Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/opendht) and is [maintained there](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/HEAD/Formula/opendht.rb), we just keep a source controlled copy here.

## Alpine Linux

Again, this is in [Alpine Linux already](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/tree/master/testing/opendht), but we keep a copy here.
